# Advanced Storage & Drives (`drives`)

USB sticks, SD cards, phones, external HDDs/SSDs, and internal system storage in the Omarchy bar: mount, open, inspect, format, auto-repair NTFS dirty bits, and safely eject without leaving the desktop.

## Advanced Features in Drives

- **Whole-Disk & Partition Formatter**: Format an entire physical drive (e.g. `/dev/sda`) or single partitions directly from the UI. Automatically cleans old signatures (`wipefs`), re-creates a clean GPT partition table via `parted`, provisions filesystems (`exfat`, `ntfs`, `ext4`, `btrfs`, `vfat`), fixes ownership/permissions, and mounts via `udisksctl`. Features built-in safeguards to strictly block system NVMe/root drives from accidental destruction.
- **NTFS Dirty-Bit Auto-Fix**: Automatically detects NTFS volumes unmountable due to Windows hibernation or dirty flags. One click runs targeted repair via `omarchy-ntfs-fix` in a presentation terminal and re-mounts the drive.
- **Disk Usage Inspector (`dua`)**: Click the pie chart icon (or press `d`) on any mounted volume to inspect space utilization interactively via `dua i` in a floating terminal.
- **Terminal at Mountpoint**: Click the terminal icon (or press `t`) on any mounted volume to immediately launch a terminal in that volume's directory.
- **System Storage Visibility Toggle**: Click the disk icon in the header (or press `s`) to toggle display of internal NVMe storage, Btrfs subvolumes, and root partitions alongside external drives.
- **Sleep / Suspend Auto-Unmount Hook**: Safely unmounts removable drives before system suspend to eliminate NTFS dirty bit corruption and ext4 journal desynchronization.

## Core Capabilities

- **Mount, open, and eject** any removable volume without a password, because
  udisks2 already lets the logged-in session do it. Ejecting unmounts every
  volume on the drive, re-locks anything encrypted, then powers it down.
- **Knows when the drive is still being written to.** The icon turns urgent
  while the kernel has I/O in flight and the panel shows the live rate, because
  a copy dialog reaching 100% is not the moment a stick is safe to pull. An
  eject asked for mid-copy is held, then fires once the drive goes quiet.
- **Names who is holding a busy mount**, instead of stopping at `target is
  busy`, and offers a lazy unmount as an explicit second choice.
- **Phones and cameras** get their own section: Android over MTP, iPhone over
  AFC and PTP, with their access labelled `Files` or `Photos`.
- **Unlocks an encrypted volume in place**, mounts it as the container opens,
  and closes it again from the same row without ejecting the drive.
- **Renames the volume label.** It travels with the stick to every machine
  that reads it, unlike a nickname, which never leaves this shell. The field
  counts down against that filesystem's own limit as you type.
- **Checks a filesystem, and repairs it only if you ask twice.** Repair is the
  one thing here that rewrites a filesystem, so it appears only after a check
  has found something, never one stray click from the mount button. A suspect
  drive mounts read-only first, so files come off without a byte going back.
- **Formats a volume, once you have said so twice.** Erasing is the only thing
  here that destroys data on purpose, so the button is on unmounted volumes
  only and the volume's own kernel name has to be typed out before anything
  runs. Pick exFAT, FAT32, NTFS, ext4 or Btrfs, name it on the way, and zero
  the drive first when you want the old contents actually gone.
- **A single drive can set its own terms.** One drive can mount read-only while
  the rest mount normally, and one drive can open — or refuse to open — after
  mounting whatever the global setting says. Both stick to the hardware, the
  same way a nickname does.
- **Reads a drive's own health**, for the drives that report any. udisks does
  that read over D-Bus and hands the answer over, so no extra package is
  needed and nothing runs as root. Most USB sticks report nothing at all, and
  a drive that reports nothing shows nothing — see below before expecting a
  number.
- **Unmounts before the machine sleeps**, optionally, so a drive pulled from a
  sleeping laptop is not left half-written, and says which one refused when
  one does.
- **Nicknames stick to the hardware**, keyed to the drive's serial rather than
  whichever `/dev/sdb` it landed on today. A drive can also run a command of
  your choosing when it appears, and that command can report its progress
  back, so a stick running a backup looks like one instead of looking idle.
- **Empties the trash you cannot see**: the `.Trash-1000` that quietly fills a
  stick with files you thought were deleted.
- **Never offers to eject the disk you booted from.** A USB-booted system disk
  reports itself as removable just like a thumb drive; anything holding `/`,
  `/boot` or `/home` is left out entirely.
- Plus: connect and remove notifications, a warning when a drive is pulled
  while still mounted, free-space bars, eject-all, and optional text beside the
  bar icon.

## Install

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/Wian47/omarchy-removable-drives.git --enable
```

Needs Omarchy 4 (Quattro) and `udisks2`, both standard. It calls `lsblk`,
`udevadm`, `udisksctl`, `busctl`, `gio`, `fuser`, `du`, `wl-copy` and Omarchy's
own `omarchy-*` helpers. Nothing runs as root.

To remove it:

```bash
omarchy plugin remove wian47.removable-drives
rm ~/.local/state/omarchy/removable-drives.json   # optional: forget nicknames
```

It never writes to `shell.json` or your Hyprland config; the bar entry belongs
to Omarchy's plugin commands and nicknames live in the file above.

### Phones

Omarchy ships `gvfs-mtp`, so **Android works out of the box**. Apple devices
speak AFC and need three packages Omarchy does not ship: `usbmuxd`, `gvfs-afc`
and `gvfs-gphoto2`.

A plugin may not install packages itself, so when something is plugged in that
gvfs cannot reach, the panel names what is missing and offers to open Omarchy's
own installer.

A trusted iPhone appears as **two** entries: app documents over AFC, and the
camera roll over PTP. With iCloud Photos set to "Optimize iPhone Storage" the
camera roll can read as empty, because the originals are not on the device.

## Settings

Set on the widget's entry in `~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`, or through
Setup > Plugins.

| Key | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `alwaysShow` | `false` | Keep the icon in the bar with nothing attached |
| `openOnMount` | `true` | Open the file manager once a volume mounts |
| `autoMountOnConnect` | `true` | Automatically mount removable volumes on plug-in |
| `autoCleanTrashOnEject` | `false` | Empty drive trash folder before ejecting |
| `showSystemDrives` | `true` | Display internal storage drives alongside removable media |
| `notifications` | `true` | Announce drives, warn when one is pulled while mounted |
| `unmountOnSuspend` | `true` | Unmount every removable volume when the machine suspends |
| `fileManager` | `""` | Command used to open a mount point; empty means `xdg-open` |
| `barLabel` | `"none"` | Text beside the icon: `none`, `free`, `name`, `count` |
| `refreshIntervalSec` | `8` | How often free space is re-read while the panel is open |

Per-drive settings live in `~/.local/state/omarchy/removable-drives.json`, keyed
by serial and watched for changes, which is also how you attach a command to a
drive:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "drives": {
    "serial:0901f8ef1ed9c144": {
      "nickname": "Work backup",
      "onConnect": "rsync -a ~/Documents/ \"$2\"/documents/",
      "autoOpen": false,
      "readOnly": true
    }
  }
}
```

`onConnect` runs through `bash -c` when that drive appears, with `$1` as its
device path, `$2` as its first mount point, and `$3` as a file it may write
progress to. Nothing writes it for you.

### Reporting progress from a hook

Write `key=value` lines to `$3`, which means one `echo` is enough:

```
percent=42
status=Copying documents
```

Both keys are optional; `done=1` says the hook has finished, and a bare number
on its own line is read as a percent. The panel draws a bar on the drive row
while the hook runs and shows the status beside it. A hook that reports
nothing still counts, it just has no bar.

The drive counts as busy for as long as the hook runs, so an eject asked for
mid-copy is held and fires once the hook is done — the same as for a copy the
kernel can see. That matters because the kernel cannot see this one: an rsync
goes quiet between file batches, and the busy icon goes out with it.

The file lives under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, so it never reaches your disk and
never outlives the session. The panel watches the hook's process rather than
the file, so a hook that dies mid-copy ends the bar instead of leaving it
stuck at 42% forever.

A hook that says what it is doing, in one line:

```json
"onConnect": "echo 'status=Backing up' > \"$3\"; rsync -a ~/Documents/ \"$2\"/docs/; echo done=1 > \"$3\""
```

A hook written before `$3` existed is unaffected: it is a new argument, not a
changed one.

### Drive health

A drive that reports SMART gets a health icon on its row, with its temperature
and hours powered on in the tooltip and any concern written out in the row
itself. It comes from udisks over D-Bus, which does the privileged read for
us — no `smartctl`, no `smartmontools`, nothing running as root.

The reading is taken when the drive appears and when you rescan, not
continuously, so the temperature is a snapshot from that moment rather than a
live thermometer. Clicking the health icon takes a fresh one.

**Most USB sticks report nothing at all**, and that is the ordinary case rather
than a fault: a thumb drive carries neither SMART interface, so the icon simply
does not appear. External SSDs and hard drives behind a SAT-capable bridge are
the ones that answer. Do not read a missing icon as a problem.

No temperature threshold is invented here. The number is shown as udisks gives
it, because a figure you can read and look up beats a line drawn on a guess.

`autoOpen` overrides `openOnMount` for this drive alone: `true` always opens,
`false` never does, and leaving it out follows the global setting. `readOnly`
mounts every volume on the drive read-only, which is what an archive disk you
never want written to wants. The panel writes both from the drive row, and
reads them strictly on the way back in: a `readOnly` that is neither `true` nor
`false` is taken as `true`, because a typo in this file must not be the reason
an archive drive came up writable.

## Scripting

```bash
omarchy-shell drives toggle
omarchy-shell drives refresh                       # re-read what is attached
omarchy-shell drives list                          # drives, as JSON
omarchy-shell drives phones                        # phones, as JSON
omarchy-shell drives network                       # network & cloud mounts, as JSON
omarchy-shell drives status                        # {"busy":false,…}
omarchy-shell drives eject /dev/sdb                # or ejectAll
omarchy-shell drives rename /dev/sdb "Work backup" # "" clears it
omarchy-shell drives label /dev/sdb1 "Photos"      # the label on the drive
omarchy-shell drives check /dev/sdb1               # verdict lands in status
omarchy-shell drives smart /dev/sdb                # health, as JSON
omarchy-shell drives mountReadOnly /dev/sdb1       # rescue without writing
omarchy-shell drives lock /dev/mapper/luks-…       # close an open container
omarchy-shell drives format /dev/sdb1 exfat Photos # erases the volume
omarchy-shell drives expandDevice /dev/sdb         # expand drive settings
omarchy-shell drives expandVolume /dev/sdb1        # expand volume drawer
omarchy-shell drives toggleTelemetry /dev/sdb      # toggle telemetry row
omarchy-shell drives setTab network                # switch to "local" or "network"
```

`format` destroys what is on the volume. It takes the same refusals the panel
does — a mounted volume, a drive still being written to, or a filesystem udisks
will not create are all turned away with the reason — but naming the node, the
type and the label in one line is the whole confirmation, so there is no second
question the way there is in the panel.

`status` reports `busy: true` while the kernel still has I/O in flight **or a
connect hook is still running**, so a backup script can wait for the drive to
settle; both eject calls wait by themselves. `hooks` says which drive is at
what percent, and `health` carries each drive's verdict — `unsupported`,
`healthy`, `warning` or `failing`. `check` returns straight away and leaves its
own verdict in `status` as `healthy`: `true`, `false`, or `null` when the
answer could not be read.

`smart` returns the whole record, and answers `supported: false` with every
other field `null` for the many drives that report no health at all.

Anything other than `ok` back from these is the reason they did not run, so a
script never has to guess whether a refusal happened.

## How it works

`Panel.qml` draws the bar icon and popup, `Service.qml` owns everything that
touches the system, and `Model.js` is pure parsing and formatting with no QML
or processes, which is what makes it testable without a compositor.

Device-supplied strings (labels, vendor names, phone names) are hostile
input: whoever formatted a stick chooses its label. Every `Text` is pinned to
`Text.PlainText` so Qt cannot promote one to rich text and fetch a remote
`<img>`, and strings handed to components whose `Text` this plugin does not own
are stripped of angle brackets first. Paths stay byte-exact, since commands are
built from them.

Renaming a filesystem, running its fsck, and creating a new one are things
udisks exposes on D-Bus that `udisksctl` has no verb for, so they go over the
bus through `busctl`. It is still `allow_active: yes`, the same no-password
path mounting takes. The object path is asked for rather than built, since
udisks escapes the kernel name into it and an unlocked LUKS volume lands at
`dm_2d3`. The rename and the fsck unmount the filesystem first and mount it
back afterwards, whether or not the middle step worked; the format does
neither, because a mounted volume is refused outright rather than taken offline
on the way to being erased.

A format is checked as one plan — which volume, which type, which label,
whether to zero the drive first — rather than as four arguments each looked at
somewhere along the way, and the plan names the `/dev` node it was made for, so
swapping the stick between planning it and confirming it retracts the format
instead of pointing it at the replacement.

Health comes the same way, off `org.freedesktop.UDisks2.Drive.Ata` or
`org.freedesktop.UDisks2.NVMe.Controller` on the drive object — one further
lookup, since health belongs to the drive rather than to a block device.

Reading those properties does not refresh them: udisks hands back whatever its
own last poll cached, which measured ten minutes stale here — the bus said
308 K while every sensor on the same drive said 36.85 °C. So `SmartUpdate` is
called first, which is `allow_active: yes` in the udisks policy like everything
else here. It is still read rarely — once when the attached set changes and
again on a rescan, never on the free-space timer — because it is now a round
trip to the drive itself, and because every answer but the temperature changes
over hours rather than seconds. The update is best-effort: a drive that refuses
one is still read, since a stale number beats no number. `nowakeup` goes to
ATA, so a parked external disk is not spun up merely to draw a temperature.

A LUKS passphrase reaches udisks on stdin, never as an argument, because
`/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is readable by every other process you run. udisksctl
takes a key only from a file, so it is staged under `umask 077` in the
RAM-backed runtime directory and a trap removes it however the unlock ends.

Emptying a drive's trash is the only recursive delete here, so the path is
re-derived from the live mount list and must exactly match a `.Trash-<uid>`
candidate of a mounted removable volume. The tests assert it refuses `/`,
`$HOME`, the mount root, and drives it is not tracking.

```bash
node test/model.test.js       # 237 tests, no compositor required
omarchy plugin validate .     # the same check the shell applies
```
