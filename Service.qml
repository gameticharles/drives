  // already does the privileged read and publishes the answer over the bus on
  // the same allow_active path mounting takes.
  //
  // Most drives will answer with nothing. Only an external SSD or a hard drive
  // behind a SAT-capable bridge reports health at all; a USB thumb drive
  // carries neither interface, and that silence is the normal answer rather
  // than something to explain.

  // Both interfaces are asked of every drive and the absent one simply answers
  // nothing, which costs less than asking udisks which of the two a drive has
  // and then asking again.
  //
  // The object path is resolved rather than built, the same way fsScript does
  // it — and health lives on the drive object rather than the block one, so it
  // takes the second lookup to get there.
  //
  // Reading the properties does not refresh them. udisks hands back whatever
  // its own last poll cached, which measured ten minutes stale here: the bus
  // said 308 K while every hwmon sensor on the same drive said 36.85 °C, a gap
  // of two degrees that is staleness rather than arithmetic. So SmartUpdate is
  // called first. It is `allow_active: yes` in the udisks policy — the same
  // no-password path everything else here takes — under
  // org.freedesktop.udisks2.ata-smart-update and its nvme twin.
  //
  // Best-effort, and deliberately not `|| continue`: a drive that refuses an
  // update is still read, because a stale number beats no number. `nowakeup`
  // goes to ATA, which is the interface that takes it, so a parked external
  // disk is not spun up merely to draw a temperature. An NVMe has no heads to
